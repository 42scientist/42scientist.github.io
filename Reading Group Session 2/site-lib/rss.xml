Doing so will yield a somewhat "fairly" secret key.Info
This key will only be fairly secret, as other individuals might also know such shared information, and Eve might be able to gather some through various means.
Naturally, Alice and Bob want to find a scheme to create an actually secret key from this fairly secret starting key.Introducing privacy amplification :Alice and Bob share a "weak secret" which comes from some distribution , represented as a random variable called the source.
While the distribution of may not be known, is available to both parties.Eve possesses side information which might be correlated to , such as its first bit, its parity, or even some quantum state .The goal for Alice and Bob is to generate some such that from the point of view of Eve, (chosen from a distribution ) is (close to) uniformally random.Note
The size of will depend on how secret the original secret is. If there is not much that can be done.
Intuitively, this will be quantified by the min-entropy .
Let's first start with a simpler problem, Alice has some source from which she gathers a string , which is possibly correlated with , with the promise that (with this condition, is called a -source), and is tasked to generate such that the distribution is close to uniform even conditionned on . Similar setup as before, but Alice is on her own and does not have to coordinate with bob.Note
While Alice could just sample from an actually uniform distribution, or measure in the Hadamard basis a bunch of times, assume here that randomness is costly, and Alice does not have ready access to large amounts of randomness for free. The goal is to extract randomness from X.
If has a distribution consisting of i.i.d. variables , one can extract a single bit nearly uniformly by taking the parity of all the bitsExample i.i.d., take .
If has probability 3/4 of being 1, 1/4 of being 0, for we have , . Not quite uniform, but better than what we started with, and better still for increasing .
One can use the same approach for variables which aren't identically distributed, and get a single bit close to a uniform distribution. However this is not very efficient.Using a deterministic function to extract randomness (such as ) can only get you so far however, since for any , even if , there is no function that can always extract bits of randomness from .Instead, we need to expand the scope to seeded extractor functions, which use a seed as a source of randomness. However, since this randomness may be costly, the seed should be of relatively small size compared to and .Definition
A weak seeded extractor is a function Ext : such that for any -source ,
With uniformally distributed, independent from and .
One might think that one could simply use the seed as randomness, but Alice and Bob could not choose the same seed as a private key without communicating it publicly.This induces the definition for a strong seeded extractor, where the extractor's input is independent from the seedDefinition
A strong seeded extractor is a function Ext : such that for any -source ,
With uniformally distributed, independent from and .
Intuitively, the min-entropy gives an estimate of how much randomness there is to extract from , but it is a valid question to seek if a strong seeded extractor really can extract bits from if it has (meaning it is a -source).If , it is impossible to extract more than bits from while still being uncorrelated to , because you can guess the value of the extractor function by guessing first then applying the function, so , in particular .]]></description><link>session-2-improving-security.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Session 2 - Improving Security.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 17:46:01 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
